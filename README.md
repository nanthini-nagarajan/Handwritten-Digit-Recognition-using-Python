# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-Python
Deep Learning Project

I developed a handwritten digit recognition app using the MNIST dataset. The project utilized Convolutional Neural Networks, a specialized type of deep neural network. I also created a GUI that allows users to draw a digit and have it recognized instantly.
